Monastery restricts your browsing session and blocks and limits time spent on sites in a user-supplied blacklist.

If you've ever used StayFocusd on Google Chrome, then you'll be pretty familiar with Monastery. Built to be Firefox's equivalent of StayFocusd, it contains all the main features and will help Firefox users restrain themselves from their procrastination urges.

Monastery consists of a timer that will count down on any of the blacklisted pages supplied by the user. When the hourglass is up, the blacklisted pages are blocked.
The amount of time available each day to browse the blacklisted sites is editable, although the amount of time and the list of pages cannot be edited when the current day's hourglass time is up. Lastly, notifications can be set to present a browser notification whenever the hourglass nears its end, and/or as set by the user in the settings.

By putting "reddit.com," "facebook.com," and "tumblr.com," for example, and setting the blocking time to thirty minutes, Monastery will permit a total of thirty minutes on any of those sites - perhaps ten on tumblr, twenty on facebook, and none on reddit - and then block all subsequent visits to any of those pages until the next day.
